    <h3>SUPPORT THE FAMILY</h3>
    <img src="public\images\pic88.jpg" alt="An image of computer man" style="float: top;" width="100%" />
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> The family is the foundation of human society. For any society to survive, the family has to be put on the forefront of any development and prosperity program. At Child Smile Foundation, 
  we have come to realise that without adequate support to the family, especially helping the head of families, there will be no true development and prosperity in any society. supporting the education 
  of a child from a poor family without helping his parents to get out of poverty, little results can be expected from such kind action. We just need to support the family head, then the family will support the children within that family.</p>
    <h3>HOW TO MAKE CHILDREN HAPPY</h3>
    <img src="public\images\pic40.jpg" alt="An image of a sea shore" style="float:top" width="100%" />
    <p>As an organization, we focus on the basic rights of the children which include the right to health, education, family life, play and recreation, rights to be protected from abuse and harm.
      <ul>
          <li>Right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health.</li>
          <li>Right to non-discrimination.</li>
          <li>Right to be protected from economic exploitation.</li>
          <li>Rights to be protected from unnecessary treatment and investigation.</li>

          <li>Right to have their parents with them.</li>
          <li>Right to privacy.</li>
          <li>Right to be informed.</li>
          <li>Right to be heard and express their wishes, concerns and fears.</li>

    <h4>CHILDREN'S EDUCATION CENTER</h4>
    <img src="public\images\pic81.jpg" alt="An image of a sea shore" style="float:top" width="100%" />
    <p>As a way to reduce ignorance and illiteracy, our organization has set up an educational centre to try and support some orphans and vulnerable children who could not be allowed in the schools in their community because 
      their families cannot affort to pay school fees and school requirements in those schools. This educational centre was established in 2009 in a four rooms makeshift structure to help vulnerable children to be in school. 
      This centre was set up at Ssisa Sub-county headquarters in Wakiso district many years ago. This education center has helped many children to receive primary education in many local communities in Wakiso district without discrimination. 
      We wish to continue supporting many more children with this initiative as long as the funds are available to run the institution.
  </p>
  <p>We are proudly happy to announce that all the 8 candidates presented to the national examinations 
      for the end of their primary education passed with flying colors. 
      Congratulations to our dear candidates. congratulations to our dear staff and parents for the great 
      support to your sons and daughters. We are forever grateful for the great work well done.</p>
    <h4>YOUR SUPPORT</h4>
    <p>Your generous contributions and donations will make a positive change in the 
      life of many children in our communities. Our appeal goes to any person of good 
      will who can support us with construction materials, tools, food, clothes, books
      or money that will enable us to complete the construction project for 
      Mercy Nursery and primary school in Lweza. </p>

    <h2>WHO WE ARE </h2>
    <img src="public\images\pic74.jpg" alt="An image of a sea shore" style="float:top" width="100%" />
    <p>We are an organization that promotes the physical, spiritual, mental and Academic welfare of children in Wakiso District. Many children around the world are victims of discrimination, hatred, poor upbringing, lack of parental care, missed education opportunities and much more.</p>
    <p>Child Smile Foundation is here for the best interests of the children especially those born from very poor families with little means to live on and having enormous difficulties in their communities. Our organization supports such children by giving them the opportunity to get to the source of wisdom.</p>
    <p>Education is such an amazing opportunity that helps one change his life for the better and make decisions in life that can benefit the person, the family and the community. Education is the best tool to change lives. It is the best tool to fight ignorance and illiteracy and poverty. We support the children now for the better future of humanity.</p>

<p>Child Smile Foundation is the right place for the education of the orphans and vulnerable. Our organization promotes the rights of children and encourages all stakeholders and partners to play their roles in supporting the children by promoting their rights to play, their rights to education, safety and protection, their rights to eating good food and access 
  to clean water. Children also need enough rest and sleep to promote both their physical and mental growth among others.</p>
<p>Children also need parental care and disciple based on love and correction, not necessarily physical punishment, they need to develop wholesome respect for elders and other adults.
  Children need to understand both their rights and obligations as children but also they must be taught to understand and respect the rights of others in the community including the rights of their parents, and the rights of all other members of the community, the big and the small. 
</p>
<p>Child Smile Foundation was created in 2007 when the leading members of this organization realized that many children in Wakiso District were abandoned at early age by their family relatives for so many reasons. After realising that many parents could be victims of accidents and chronic diseases and leaving
  their children alone at a very tender age, we saw it fit to start an organization that could quickly intervene when tragedy strikes.

  <h3>CHILDREN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS</h3>
  <p>In 1989 the United Nations declared the convention of the rights of children, promoting the rights and the protection of children to develop their full potential, free from hunger and want, neglect and abuse.
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, millions of children around the world are still victims of child abuse,
     discrimination, child labour, child sacrifice, child neglect and sexual exploitation among others and just little is done or nothing to protect the children.</p>

  
  <h3>RIGHTS TO NON-DISCRIMINATION</h3>
  <p>"All children should be treated in a respectful and empathic way, whatever their race, religion or abilities; whatever they think or say, whatever type of family they come from. It doesn't matter where children live,
    what language they speak, what their parents do, whether they are boys or girls, what their culture is, whether they have a disability or whether are rich or poor. No child should be treated unfairly on any basis."
</p>
<h3>THINGS THAT MAKE CHILDREN SMILE</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Involve them in a grownup decision.</li>
  <li>Introduce them to your favorite treat from your own childhood.</li>
  <li>Frame a piece of their art and put it in a prominent place.</li>
  <li>Clean their room for them.</li>
  <li>Make their favorite breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</li>
  <li>Tell them the story of when they were born.</li>
  <li>Give them plenty of play time.</li>
  <li>Listen to your child.</li>
  <li>Practice gratitude.</li>
  <li>Spend quality time with your child.</li>
  <li>Play with your children, love them in words and actions</li>
  <li>Take him to places where he can learn how things work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FAMILY SUPPORT EMPOWERMENT</h3>
<p>To support effectively the children from poor families and backgrounds, we came to realise that we must support the families and caregivers. It may not make a great impact to offer free education to a child who comes 
  from a very poor family if that family cannot provides even for the basics of that child's needs. The truth is that we must empower the family to support the child. Remember that we may provide free education to an orphan 
  but the family will provide shelter, protection, food, clothes and healthcare concerns when this child falls sick. This is a clear indication that if we want to support the children in effective ways then we must support 
  their families that are bucking them up in various ways.
</p>
<p>The cause of poverty in most african countries is caused by the fact that families cannot afford even the minimum of their daily needs. If we address the poverty at family level, then we are on the right path. 
  Addressing poverty at family level is to address poverty at the root level. This is very important to understand, poverty must be fought at family level, heads of the families must be empowered to care 
  for their own. When families are empowered to care for their own, they do it with much joy because the family is caring for what is its own. The children belong to the family first before they belong to the State. 
  This is a fact that both the State institutions and the family institution must understand if both are determined to save the family and the children. All the efforts put in this direction is worthwhile because 
  it will bear good fruits in the future when the family is stable and support back the government in many ways. If we want to reduce poverty in any community, the family is the starting point and not the last. 
</p>
<h3>OUR ACTIONS</h3>
<p>Our actions and activities are centered on children. When you donate, your donations 
  will be used on projects directly benefiting the children. Education of children 
  is our first priority because we believe that education is 
  key to success in all communities when acquired and used appropriately.</p>
<p>The reason why we are appealing to you all to support us and donate to this project 
  is that many children are mistreated in our communities. They need support and 
  necessary aid to save them from difficult circumstances of life they are facing. They are 
  victims of difficult circumstances despite their young age and lack of knowledge. 
  Please consider to support the children in our project. Children who are denied their 
  right may become bitter, taking out their frustrations on society as a whole.</p>
<p>If you are out tere and willing to support any child of your coice at Child Smile Foundation, please do not hesitate to contact us. You can visit our Contact Us page and drop some lines over there. We will be very happy
   to write back to you and give all all the necessary information you need in order to begin your journey of supporting a child from our organization.
